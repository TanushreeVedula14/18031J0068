Suppose that the sequence P R I O * R * * I * T * Y * * * Q U E * * * U * E (where a letter means insert and an asterisk 
means remove the maximum) is applied to an initially empty priority queue. 
Give the sequence of values returned by remove the maximum operations.

I O P R
*
I O P R
* 
*
I O I
*
I O T

*
U
*
E

Sequence of values returned is 1(E).
