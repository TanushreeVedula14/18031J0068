Q) Suppose that a certain BST has keys that are integers between 1 and 10, and we search for 5. 
   Which sequence below cannot be the sequence of keys examined? Why?

   a. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5 
   b. 4, 10, 8, 7, 3, 5
   c. 1, 10, 2, 9, 3, 8, 4, 7, 6, 5 
   d. 2, 7, 3, 8, 4, 5 
   e. 1, 2, 10, 4, 8, 5

Ans) d because when we put them in order 8 will be out of place ie. 8 is more than its root, root element.
